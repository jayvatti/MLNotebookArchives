# Training Data for ML Models

This repository contains the training data for various machine learning models. Below are the details of each file:

## `height_weight.csv`

- **Description**: Linear regression CSV file with a strong positive linear relationship between height and weight.
- **Relationship**: Strong positive linear relationship.
- **Usage**: Suitable for training linear regression models predicting weight based on height.

## `multipleFeatures.csv`

- **Description**: Linear regression CSV file with multiple features.
- **Relationship**: Linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
- **Usage**: Suitable for training linear regression models involving multiple features.

## `polyRegression.csv`

- **Description**: CSV file for polynomial regression.
- **Relationship**: Polynomial relationship between the features and the target variable.
- **Usage**: Suitable for training polynomial regression models.

## `logisticRegression.csv`

- **Description**: CSV file for binary logistic regression.
- **Relationship**: Two features (x1, x2, y1).
- **Target Variable**: Represents the acceptance of a test result (Positive = 1, Negative = 0).
- **Decision Boundary**: Exhibits a straight line.
- **Usage**: Suitable for logistic regression, logistic loss, and sigmoid functions.

## `logisticRegressionCircular.csv`

- **Description**: CSV file for binary logistic regression with an approximate circular boundary.
- **Features**: Two features (x1, x2).
- **Target Variable**: Represents the acceptance of a test result (Positive = 1, Negative = 0).
- **Decision Boundary**: Exhibits an approximate circular pattern.
- **Usage**: Suitable for logistic regression with higher-order equations, logistic loss, and sigmoid functions.

Please note that the provided information assumes familiarity with linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression concepts.
