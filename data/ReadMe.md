# Machine Learning Datasets Playground

The playground where data narrates intriguing tales and machines lend a listening ear.

## [`height_weight.csv`](height_weight.csv)
- **Description**: A lovely couple - height and weight! They share a strong positive linear relationship.
- **Usage**: Makes for a delightful first date with linear regression, predicting weight based on height.

## [`multipleFeatures.csv`](multipleFeatures.csv)
- **Description**: An ensemble of features, each contributing to the story. Linear relationships all around.
- **Usage**: Perfect setting for diving into multiple feature linear regression. An orchestra of features, if you will.

## [`polyRegression.csv`](polyRegression.csv)
- **Description**: Life isn't always linear, sometimes it's polynomial. 
- **Usage**: Set the stage for polynomial regression models to unfold their non-linear magic.

## [`logisticRegression.csv`](logisticRegression.csv)
- **Description**: A binary logistic regression dataset that believes in simplicity, projecting a straight line decision boundary.
- **Usage**: An ideal scenario for logistic regression models to flaunt their classification prowess.

## [`logisticRegressionCircular.csv`](logisticRegressionCircular.csv)
- **Description**: A binary logistic regression dataset that enjoys a bit of curve, revealing an almost circular decision boundary.
- **Usage**: A playfield for logistic regression models with higher-order equations to take a swing.

## [`linearRegressionSimple.csv`](linearRegressionSimple.csv)
- **Description**: A classic single feature and target dataset.
- **Usage**: The perfect playground for beginners in linear regression. As uncomplicated as it gets.

## [`logisticRegressionTumorSingle.csv`](logisticRegressionTumorSingle.csv)
- **Description**: A binary logistic regression dataset with a serious cause - classifying tumors as malignant or benign based on size.
- **Usage**: Ideal for logistic regression models looking to make a positive impact in the medical field.

Note: The fun descriptions are simply metaphoric. The data files are as serious as they sound, perfect for your machine learning models to practice their skills.
